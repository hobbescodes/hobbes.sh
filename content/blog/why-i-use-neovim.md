# Why I Use Neovim

## The Beginning

Like many developers, I started with VS Code.
It's a great editor with excellent extensions and ease of use.

But something was missing. I spent too much time reaching
for the mouse, navigating menus, and clicking buttons.


## The Switch

I made the switch to Neovim in 2022 and never looked back.

The learning curve was steep, but the payoff was worth it:

  - Blazing fast startup time
  - Complete keyboard control
  - Infinite customization
  - Runs anywhere (SSH, containers, etc.)


## My Setup

### Core Plugins
  - lazy.nvim for plugin management
  - telescope.nvim for fuzzy finding
  - nvim-lspconfig for language servers
  - nvim-treesitter for syntax highlighting
  - oil.nvim for file navigation

### Quality of Life
  - which-key.nvim for keybinding hints
  - gitsigns.nvim for git integration
  - lualine.nvim for a pretty status line


## Tips for Beginners

  1. Start with a distro like LazyVim or NvChad
  2. Learn the motions before customizing
  3. Add plugins slowly, one at a time
  4. Don't try to replicate VS Code


## Conclusion

Neovim has made me a more efficient developer.
The initial investment pays dividends every day.

Give it a try - your future self will thank you.
