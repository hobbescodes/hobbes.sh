# Coming Soon

This space is currently empty, but not for long.

I'm planning to start writing about my experiences building
things on the web. No set schedule, just sharing when
something feels worth talking about.

## What to Expect

- Frameworks and tools that excite me (TanStack, Tailwind, Rust, etc.)
- Terminal workflows and developer tooling (Neovim, Ghostty, the usual suspects)
- Approaches and patterns I've found useful
- Products and projects worth checking out
- Lessons learned from being self-taught

## Stay Tuned

Check back later. Or don't. I'm not your boss.
