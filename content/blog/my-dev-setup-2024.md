# My Development Setup in 2024

## Overview

Here's a tour of my current development setup.
It's heavily terminal-focused and optimized for speed.


## Hardware

  - MacBook Pro M3 Max
  - 32GB RAM
  - 1TB SSD
  - Studio Display


## Terminal

### Ghostty

Ghostty is my terminal of choice. It offers:

  - GPU-accelerated rendering
  - Native macOS integration
  - Excellent font rendering
  - Low latency input


## Shell

### Zsh + Starship

I use Zsh with the Starship prompt for:

  - Fast, minimal prompt
  - Git status at a glance
  - Language version display


## Editor

Neovim, of course! See my other post for details.


## Other Tools

  - tmux for session management
  - lazygit for git operations
  - ripgrep for fast searching
  - fzf for fuzzy finding
  - zoxide for smart cd


## Dotfiles

All my configuration is managed with:

  - chezmoi for dotfile management
  - GitHub for version control
  - Automated setup scripts


## Conclusion

A well-tuned development environment is a joy to use.
Invest time in your tools - they pay dividends.
